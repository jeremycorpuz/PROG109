    <div class="content">
        <p><i>Hi, I'm Jeremy, an aspiring graphic designer.</i>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-left: 25px;">I was born in Vancouver, Canada, but grew up in Seattle for most of my life.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-left: 25px;">I decided to join this class because I was interested in the web development that goes hand in hand with UI/UX Design.
            As I'm steadily going into the graphic design field, basic knowledge of HTML & CSS would be a useful skill to have under my belt. 
            I can better understand how aesthetic design is incorporated onto websites while catering to the accessibility and usabillity requirements that web developers take priority in.
            Accessibility & Usability was a significant concept to learn about, that although a website may be aesthetically appealing, the way users interact with the site is important to how they percieve and acquire information.
            I'm glad that I was able to learn the fundamentals and hope to continue developing these skills in order to create my own graphic design portfolio.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-left: 25px;">I'm passionate in anything that's creative whether it's painting, drawing, cinematography, etc. I also ocassionally pick up my guitar to pass time. If you're interested in looking at some work I've done, I've included recent pieces in my creative page. 
            I am planning on pursing a bachelors in graphic design, aiming to attend RISD (Rhode Island School of Design) in Providence.
